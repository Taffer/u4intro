# Ultima 4 Data

The `TITLE.EXE` file is an executable from the DOS version of *Ultima IV -
Quest of the Avatar*. It's Â© 1985, 2011 Electronic Arts Inc.

You can get *Ultima IV* for DOS free from GOG.com:
https://www.gog.com/en/game/ultima_4 I highly recommend it if you want to try
a retro pixel-art game; it works great in DOSbox.

`TITLE.EXE` is *not* covered by the [LICENSE](../LICENSE.md) applied to the
rest of this repo, it's merely provided as a convenience. Without the rest of
the *Ultima IV* data and executables, it's not runnable.
